# React44ms.Api.useCallback

`useCallback` same as [useCallback in React](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn)

Not `React`. It doesn't even know React exists.

It uses a proxy which calls your function all stored in the source of truth component of your implementation I'm describing the ootb experience.
